.SH SYNOPSIS

[
.B \-n
]
.IR url 
.IR input-omf-file 
.IR output-omf-file
.SH DESCRIPTION
scrollkeeper-preinstall creates the OMF file 
.IR output-omf-file 
by reading the given existing 
OMF file 
.IR input-omf-file 
and replacing the URL for a resource (typically a document) with
the URL given by
.IR url .
This is typically done as part of the build process for 
an application, since the actual location that a document 
is installed is not known until the application is built.

If 
.I output-omf-file
is specified with a path, and that path does not exist, 
the path is created.

The 
.IR url
is typically the "file:" URI followed by the absolute path
to a document which is (or will be) installed. 
(eg. "file:/usr/doc/scrollkeeper/scrollkeeper.sgml")
