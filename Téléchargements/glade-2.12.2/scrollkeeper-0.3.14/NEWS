0.3.13
=======
Released on: 7 December 2003.

- Runtime fixes:
	- Use a per-user directory for storing the extracted contents files.
	  This avoids problems when multiple users share /tmp and use
	  scrollkeeper.
	- Do XInclude processing on documents before extracting information.
	- By default, do not use the network to retrieve required DTDs.
		- Can be changed using the '-n' parameter to
		  scrollkeeper-install and friends.
	- Do not segfault if an OMF file is invalid.

- Build fixes:
	- Install various package documentation files.
	- Tidy up the build process a little bit and fix some portability bugs.
	- Update included gettext code.
	- Build fixes for specific platforms (Solaris and *BSD systems).
	- Detect installed version of the DocBook DTD at build time.
	- Allow the location of system XML catalog to be specified.
		- see the --with-xml-catalog flag.
	- Install locale-specific program files correctly (i.e. portably).
	- Allow scrollkeeper data directory to be customised
		- see the --with-partial-db-dir flag.
	- Upgrade supplied gettext and automake versions.

- Miscellaneous:
	- Correctly register translated versions of documents by considering
	  their category, rather than their titles.
	- Don't leak file descriptors when updating the database. This fixes
	  resource starvation problems on some systems.
	- Fix some memory leaks.
	- Should now work with IPv6-enabled systems.
	- When using a non-default prefix, the scrollkeeper log files are
	  updated correctly.
	- Many Sourceforge bug tracker bugs fixed and all outstanding patches
	  in the patch tracker evaluated and applied if appropriate.
